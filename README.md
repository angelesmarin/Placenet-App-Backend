# Placenet Backend 
This is the backend for our Placenet react native mobile application so that our [front end](https://github.com/angelesmarin/Placenet-App-Frontend/tree/main) can interact with our backend api routes. We chose to create different repositories for modularity. These are the steps we took to set up the backend for our app:

## 1. Make a RESTFUL API (Node.js; Express.js)
We first initialized our project and set up our server using Express.js.

**API**: set of rules to allow communication between back & front end; lets front end request, send, and receive data to & from the server. 


**RESTful API**: will let app fetch, send, update, delete data by making HTTP requests to server. 
â€“
Done by 
- intializing express.js project
- creating entry point: app.js 


## 2. Make Basic API structure (Express.js)
**Routes**: what happens when a url is accessed 



Our App's basic structure is as follows, with the following components for Routes, Controllers, and Models:
* user authentication
* property management
* projct management
* document management 

## 3. Make PostgreSQL Database (PostgreSQL)
  
## 4. Connect runtime to database (pg library)

## 5. Implement CRUD in API  

## 6. Test API endpoints (Insomnia)

## 7. Connect frontend (https://github.com/angelesmarin/Placenet-App-Frontend) to baackend (React Native)
