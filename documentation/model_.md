## Model Folder 
'Model's here represents the tables we have in our database, defining how the data stored behaviors and its structure. 
* these sequelize nidels help interact with our database
* once models are defined, they are used to perform CRUD opererations. 


We already make tables in our database, so the oal was to create models to match the structure in the table, **syncing** these sequelize models with our existing tables
